        <p>This Privacy Policy governs the use of the Wordflow Google Doc Add-on extension (the "Extension") and outlines the types of information collected by the Extension and how it is used. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Extension. By using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Extension.</p>

        <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
        <p>The Extension DOES NOT collect or store any personal or sensitive information. It only stores community-shared prompts and the number of times a prompt is run. All prompts are directly sent to external LLM APIs such as Google Gemini Pro and OpenAI GPT 4. Please refer to their data privacy policy for more details (Gemini API and OpenAI API). All private prompts are stored locally in the client's browser local storage.</p>

        <h4>Data Security</h4>
        <p>The Extension is designed to prioritize user privacy and DOES NOT collect any personal data. Therefore, there is no risk of unauthorized access or misuse of user data.</p>
