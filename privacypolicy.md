# Privacy Policy

Created: March 11, 2024

Last updated: March 11, 2024

This Privacy Policy governs the use of the Wordflow Google Doc Add-on extension (the "Extension") and outlines the types of information collected by the Extension and how it is used. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Extension. By using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Extension.

## Information Collection and Use

The Extension DOES NOT collect or store any personal or sensitive information. It only stores community-shared prompts and the number of times a prompt is run. All prompts are directly sent to external LLM APIs such as Google's Gemini Pro and OpenAI's GPT 4. All private prompts/API keys/etc. are stored securely within UserProperties provided by the [PropertiesService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties-service) of Google. 

## AI Models
The only AI models at use in Wordflow are the external LLM options provided within the add-on including OpenAI's GPT 4 and Google's Gemini Pro. The only data shared with these models is the necessary prompting information (provided by the user) to receive LLM output (this level of sharing is necessary for the add-on to function as intended). No prompting data is stored within Wordflow (other than shared community prompts). 

If using GPT within Wordflow, please refer to the [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

If using Gemini Pro within Wordflow, please refer to the [Gemini Apps Privacy Hub](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en#collected_data&zippy=%2Cwhat-data-is-collected-how-is-it-used%2Cwhy-is-human-review-of-my-gemini-apps-conversations-feedback-and-related-data-required%2Cdo-you-use-my-gemini-apps-conversations-to-show-me-ads%2Cwho-has-access-to-my-gemini-apps-conversations).

## Data Security

The Extension is designed to prioritize user privacy and DOES NOT collect any personal data. Therefore, there is no risk of unauthorized access or misuse of user data.

## Limited Use Disclosure
Wordflow's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
